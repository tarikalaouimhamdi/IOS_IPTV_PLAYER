As streaming continues to dominate media consumption, building a custom IPTV player can be a powerful way to deliver a tailored and high-quality experience. In this article, I’ll walk you through the design and architecture of an **iOS IPTV Player** I developed — a modular, Chromecast-ready, VLC-powered application built in Swift and SwiftUI.

---

## **🎯 What Is This Project?**

This project is a fully customizable **IPTV player for iOS** that supports:

- Live TV, VOD, and Series playback

- Favorites management and content shelves

- Google Cast support via the Cast SDK

- Powerful video playback using the **VLC iOS SDK**

- Modular Swift architecture using SwiftUI and Combine

The app was designed to be extendable, lightweight, and built with modern Apple technologies.

## **🎥 Why Use the VLC SDK?**

Apple’s native video player works great for many use cases, but IPTV streaming often involves:

- Unstable or non-standard streams (M3U, RTMP, HLS, TS)

- Custom buffer handling

- Hardware decoding for better performance

That’s where [**MobileVLCKit**](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLCKit/) comes in. The VLC SDK allows:

- Support for a wide range of codecs and streaming formats

- Fine control over playback behavior

- Better error handling and stream recovery

In this project, every video is played through VLC, giving users a consistent and robust playback experience regardless of stream source.

## **🧱 Architecture Highlights**

The app follows a modular structure for scalability:

### **🔹 Components**

- Library/: UI elements like CircularProgressView, Snackbar, etc.

- Shelf/: Displays categorized rows of content (Live, Movies, Series).

- Models/: Represents entities such as Stream, Series, and Favorites.

- Protocols/: Interfaces for caching and API management.

- Fonts/: Font Awesome support for custom icons.

### **🔹 Core Features**

- **Live, VOD, and Series Shelves**

- **Search by type** with dynamic filtering

- **Favorites** system backed by local cache

- **TMDB integration** for rich media imagery

- **Chromecast support** via Google Cast SDK

- **Video playback** using the **VLC iOS SDK**

---

## **⚙️ Tech Stack**

- **Swift 5.7+**

- **SwiftUI** for UI

- **Combine** for reactive bindings

- **VLC iOS SDK** (MobileVLCKit)

- **Google Cast SDK**

- **Carthage** for dependency management

## **💻 Local Setup**

1. Clone the repo:

```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ios-iptv-player.git
cd ios-iptv-player
```

2. Install dependencies:

```plaintext
carthage bootstrap --use-xcframeworks
```

3. Open the Xcode project, build, and run on your device or simulator.

Make sure VLC and GoogleCast SDKs are properly linked. You may need to configure signing and bundle identifiers.
